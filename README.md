# Overview

rDPX V2 introduces a new synthetic coin dpxETH which is pegged to ETH. dpxETH will be used to earn boosted yields on ETH and will be a staple collateral token for future Dopex Options Products.

The rDPX bonding process represents the method in which new dpxETH tokens can be minted. When a user bonds with the rDPX V2 contract they receive a receipt token. A receipt token represents ETH and dpxETH LP on curve.

Via the bonding process new dpxETH is minted and its backing is maintained via a rDPX and ETH reserve (the Backing Reserves). These backing reserves are controlled via AMOs. To ensure a safe and controllable way to scale rDPX V2 and dpxETH together we have decided incorporate the AMO ideology from Frax Finance.

- How many contracts are in scope?: 9 (Excluding interfaces)
- Total SLoC for these contracts?:  2264 (Excluding interfaces)
- How many external imports are there?: 20+
- How many separate interfaces and struct definitions are there for the contracts within scope?:  30
- Does most of your code generally use composition or inheritance?:  Inheritance

```

## Setup

```bash
# Cloning
git clone --recurse https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex.git
# Updating with submodule if the repo was cloned without `--recurse-submodules`
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Having foundry installed: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

> (Optional) Setup the `.env` file with the vars mentioned in the `.env.sample` file.

### Compiling

```bash
forge build
```

### Running tests

Run all tests like this:

```bash
forge test
```

### Running coverage

First, comment the following to avoid a stack too deep error due to https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3357:

- [Periphery.t.sol.testUniV3Amo()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/tests/rdpxV2-core/Periphery.t.sol#L131-L221)
- [UniV3LiquidityAmo.sol.removeLiquidity()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/amo/UniV3LiquidityAmo.sol#L213-L270)

Then, to run solidity code coverage and generate the coverage reports, please use one of the following commands:

```bash
sh coverage.sh
```

or 

```bash
chmod +x coverage.sh
./coverage.sh
```

### Slither

Slither's output can be found at [./slither.txt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/slither.txt). 
You can run it on your own with `slither .`
